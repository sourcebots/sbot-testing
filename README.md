# SBot Kit Testing

- Construct Robot Kit
    - Power Board
    - Motor Board
        - With Two Motors
    - Servo Board
        - 12 servos
    - Arduino
        - Ultrasound sensor (trig: 11, echo: 10)
- Insert USB with main.py for testing.
- Observe
    - Servos will reset
    - Single Beep
    - Power Board Flashes
- Press the start button.
- Motor Board Testing
    - Motors go half, then full power. Then COAST
    - Motors repeat in reverse
    - Motors go half, then brake
    - Motors repeat in reverse
    - Motors go half, then make safe
    - Motors smoothly ramp forward, reverse, then stop
- Arduino Testing
    - Observe flashing of comms LEDs
- Servo Board Testing
    - Every servo should move it's whole rotation.
- Power Board Testing
    - Watch lights turn on and off
    - Listen to two scales, one is badly tuned.
- Servo Board LED should be Pink now.
- Remove USB.
- Observe Boards Restart
- Check the logs.
- Reinsert. Observe sequence once more.
